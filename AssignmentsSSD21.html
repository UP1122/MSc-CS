<body>	<p><u> Unit 1-3 (Introduction to Secure software development)</u></p>


<p>This unit started out with a collaborative discussion. The instructions where:</p>
<p>Select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring. 
 Which UML models might you use to present the design of your proposed software, and why are they the most appropriate choice(s)?.</p>
	
	<p>My contribution to the discussion was as follows:</p>
  
 <p>OWASP, the open web application security project is an open source nonprofit foundation to identify and help prevent the most prevalent security 
 risks in todays ever changing information based world. I have chosen to focus on the second most important risk- broken authentication. 
 This method of attack includes but is not limited to compromised passwords, sessions and keys to compromise the system. 
 Many applications use specific error messages when incorrect credentials are entered, thus providing the attacker with 
 information as to how to access the system(“A2:2017-Broken Authentication | OWASP,” n.d.).
 Another such exploit is a brute force attack, which uses computing power to try infinite combinations of username 
 and password to gain access to the system. A useful mitigation against this type of attack is the advent of 
  Multi factor authentication, which requires a secondary time sensitive input in order to access the system.  
  Microsoft estimates that 99.9% of brute force attacks would be thwarted by utilization of MFA(“Microsoft: 99.9% of 
  compromised accounts did not use multi-factor authentication | ZDNet,” n.d.).</p>

<p>Simple measures such as regularly changing passwords, implementing MFA and returning generic 
 error codes may prevent against most broken authentication attacks.</p>

<p>As a summary of the discussion, I posted the following</p>
<p> Over the course of the module, I have delved into research regarding the OWASP top 10, alongside my colleagues. 
 We all have reached similar conclusions as to the risks these vulnerabilities present, as well as ways to mitigate these risks.</p>
<p>With regards to Yohay's post on insufficient logging and monitoring, this is an area that has had a real world impact, 
 such as the Ukrainian power plant intrusion in 2015 (Whitehead et al., 2017). 
 Logging of previous intrusions and subsequent analysis may have assisted engineers in providing updates to patch these 
 vulnerabilities to prevent future breaches. Monitoring systems need to be put in place with regular analytics to detect and fix vulnerabilities.<p>

<p>Alexander's post on sensitive data exposure, allowed me to understand the importance of HTTPS versus standard HTTP. 
 It is also interesting to note that the HTTPS certificate may be obtained for free, thus concluding that all websites 
 containing sensitive data should not have a reason not to use HTTPS (Basques, 2019). It is also advisable not to 
 use public access networks when performing sensitive data operations, as this data may be intercepted, especially when HTTPS is not used. 
 Mitigation techniques include using a VPN and ensuring the site uses SSL encryption (Kaspersky, 2020).</p>

<p>David's post on broken authentication is crucial especially in todays ever changing information based online world. 
 Generic and reused passwords should never be used, as if one site is compromised, all accounts with the same password may be vulnerable. 
 It is also critical to use MFA, as this provides an extra layer of security against such attacks. I have found that google authenticator 
 is very useful in this regard and have applied it to many of my personal applications. A password manager, such as last pass, 
 enables secure storage of difficult to remember passwords. Biometric authentication such as fingerprint or retinal access is perhaps 
 the safest method of access control today, and should be used whenever possible, and always in conjunction with other layers of security (Khan et al., 2015).</p>

<p>IOT advancements mean that a computer chip can be placed in almost anything, and allows for network control, data analysis and overall innovation. 
 This may come at the cost of data security as a trade off for expediency. Start up and legacy companies should be aware of this, 
 and provide all possible measures to ensure data security (Sohoel, Jaatun and Boyd, 2018).</p>

<p>In conclusion, security needs to have a dual approach from the side of the developers as well as the consumers. 
 Developers need to ensure that their code is robust and constantly updated to prevent attacks, 
 while consumers need to be proactive in their security approach, with regards to passwords, MFA and always employing safe browsing techniques.</p>

	<body>	<p><u> Unit 7 (System Design)</u></p>
		<p>For this assignment we had to design the following:</p>
<p>-A class diagram.</p>
<p>-An activity diagram for the process of a customer completing an order.</p>
<p>-A state diagram highlighting the states of an order (and their transitions) for your proposed system.</p>

	<p>The scenario was as follows: You have been asked to design a software system for a well-known online store. The system will allow customers to 
		search for products sold at the website and add them to their shopping basket - at this stage an order is in progress. 
		Products are sold both by the website itself and several third-party sellers as part of the website’s marketplace. 
		Third-party sellers can be individuals or organisations, and once they have registered as a seller, they maintain their own product catalogue, 
		pricing and storefront. If a product is temporarily out of stock, then then it will be marked as unavailable.
		Once a customer has finished their shopping, the order is considered to be processing and they are taken through the checkout process, 
		where they will specify delivery details. Customers have the choice of several delivery options, including standard delivery using the 
		postal service and the company’s own in-house courier service. Products ordered from third-party sellers at the marketplace do not have 
		access to the in-house courier system. When the delivery options have been chosen, then the customer is presented with the payment options, 
		where they can opt to use a credit or debit card, an online payment service (e.g., PayPal) or a gift voucher.  
		Additionally, customers may also use promotional codes that are periodically issued by the website.  
		Customers have the option to store their payment details and so can simply use stored details for each purchase.  
		At this stage, the order is pending payment, but once the customer submits their payment information, the validity of the account 
		used (whether it is PayPal, a credit/debit card or gift voucher) will be verified by the appropriate service.  
		Upon successful completion, the order is awaiting picking. When a customer completes a transaction, the order is passed to the warehouse staff.  
		The warehouse staff will be required to look up the items on the stock database to determine the location of the item in the warehouse. 
		Once the items are successfully collected and packaged, the order will be considered ready for delivery and distributed to the 
		appropriate delivery company, depending on the customer’s preferences. When a member of the warehouse staff picks an item, 
		to fulfil a customer order, the item is scanned with a handheld terminal to automatically update the stock levels 
		(which will be reflected on the website). Finally, the order is collected by the appropriate delivery company and marked as shipped.</p>

<p><u>Unit 8 (Hands-on with Database Design)</u></p>
<p>The assignment for this unit required us to :
	identify a NoSQL technology to research. Then post in the discussion forum detailing the key approaches of your chosen technology and 
	how its relative merits when compared with a traditional relational database.
Some types of NoSQL you might want to consider include:Graph databases, Key/value stores, Document stores and Object databases</p>	
<p> My contribution to the discussion was as follows:</p>
<p>  Relational database structures, such as sql have been around for many decades, and have a sort of “one size fits all” approach. 
Recently, due to “Big Data”, the nonrelational database structure such as Nosql have become increasingly popular(Wiktorski, 2019). 
It is estimated that 2.5 billion gigabytes of data are generated every day(Kalid et al., 2017).
One such example is Googles Big table. Its stated uses are for IoT, Financial analysis and adtech. It has been proven to be highly efficient as well as increased scalability. 
Bigtable uses a unique key value map store, using a row-key, column-key and timestamp approach(Kalid et al., 2017).  A use case scenario is for financial analysis, 
in collaboration with Dow Jones. The aim was to collate 30 years’ worth of news events with financial implications on businesses, 
small and large(Cloud Bigtable: NoSQL Database Service  |  Google Cloud, n.d.) An example as per the Dow Jones website, is the effect of Hurricanes in 2017, 
on businesses. This data was used to infer relationships between entities and the effects of the hurricanes on those entities(Dow Jones Case Study  |  Google Cloud, n.d.).  
This large amount of data would not be compatible with a traditional sql database due to its unstructured nature.

With the advent of big data, artificial intelligence, IoT and others, as well as non-structural data being generated, big data companies would certainly 
benefit from using nosql databases in certain processes. Sql databases, however, still have a place, especially for businesses dealing with structural data. 
It is unlikely and unwise to assume that there can only be one method, and the “one size fits all” approach cannot apply to the current exponential growth in data generation. 
Businesses would benefit in utilizing both systems for different outcomes.</p>
<p> In response to a collegues post on the Mongodb nosql database, I researched and found the following:</p>
<p>Advantages: Sharding as you had mentioned- Utilizing the power of multiple servers for database distribution and storage(Advantages of MongoDB | Disadvantages of MongoDB - DataFlair, n.d.). 
(An obvious current disadvantage here would be regarding the environmental cost of running many servers, however, when alternative energy sources are used, 
this disadvantage would be not applicable).
Scalability- The horizontally scalable nature of the Mongodb is attractive for growing businesses, allowing them to simply add more servers in order to grow. 
As mentioned previously, Currently the use of fossil fuels would negatively impact the environment when adding more servers. The problem is negated by using renewable energy. 
Speed- Mongodb is said to be 100 times faster than traditional sql databases, resulting in greatly improved performance(Gyorodi et al., 2015).
A disadvantage that I came across related to the limit on the size of files to 16mb. However, given the compression solutions available, I doubt that this 
would be a major problem.(All About MongoDB NoSQL Database: Advantages and Disadvantages, n.d.) 
Overall, it seems to be an impressive nosql database, with many possible applications. I agree with you fully, that traditional sql databases would 
continue to have a place, as well as nosql databases such as   Mongodb, chosen in relation to the design and function of the system</p>
		
<p>As a summary, I posted the following:</p>
<p>During this discussion, I have learnt much about non sql databases. From my own research in googles big table, to other databases explored by my colleagues, 
such as Mongodb and Neo4j. From this research, I can surmise the following:Non sql databases are increasingly being used for unstructured data. 
Some are open source, but many companies have developed their own non sql databases. This leads to the companies achieving a marketplace advantage, 
depending on how user friendly and robust their specific design is.
In addition, the horizontally scalable nature as well as sharding, may lead to improved efficiency and faster request times leading to improved performance. 
It also means that nosql databases are the preferred choice for larger or ever-changing data sets (Sumalatha, Vookanti and Vannala, 2021). 
This may have a determinantal effect on the environment, as more servers lead to increased power usage, so companies that utilize this system, 
should look into renewable energy sources in their system design so as to decrease their use and reliance on fossil fuels.
A performance comparison between mongodb and mysql when using an IoT device, showed similar performance in most areas, however, 
mongodb’s response time was slightly quicker in certain requests, while mysql was more stable. The authors conclude, that depending on the usage required, 
either database may be used for specific purposes. (Rautmare and Bhalerao, 2017)  
With regards to big data, the non schema nature, as well as possibility for dynamic scalability of the no sql database structure, makes it a promising 
choice for some businesses(Venkatraman et al., 2016).
Overall, it is unlikely that all businesses will benefit from switching to nonsql databases, and as such sql should be in use for many years to come.</p>
