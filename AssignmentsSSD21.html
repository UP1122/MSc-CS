<body>	<p><u> Unit 1-3 (Introduction to Secure software development)</u></p>


<p>This unit started out with a collaborative discussion. The instructions where:</p>
<p>Select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring. 
 Which UML models might you use to present the design of your proposed software, and why are they the most appropriate choice(s)?</p>
	
	<p>A PDF of my contribution to the discussion is available to view below:</p>

<p>Unit 5</p>
<p>The focus of this unit was testing and exploring linters in python.</p>
<p> Our task was to Discuss the scenario(s) in which each technique would be important to be used for the following techniques:
<br>Specification-based techniques
<br>Structure-based techniques
<br>Experience-based techniques
<br> My notes relating to the question were as follows</p>

<body>	<p><u> Unit 6 (Design Document)</u></p>
		<p>For this assignment we were assigned groups with the following brief:</p>
<p>For this assessment, you are advised to position yourself and your team as IT Software Consultants and Developers.
You are required to develop an application for an organisation with domain-specific requirements. 
A domain refers to a group of users with similar application and hardware requirements. A domain may be characterised by having:
periodic pressure on resources (CPU, storage, or the network)
interactive response requirements between request and reply
substantial data download requirements
Such requirements place specific demands on a system’s operations, and this influences the way that it should be operated and managed.

The API should support access via a web browser and/or a command line application that will allow an authenticated user to download stored data in a read-only format.
The solution should ensure that all privacy and security regulations are met, including those specified by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (ICO, n.d.)
Mechanisms should be deployed to minimise the attack surface of the solution.
The organisation would like to see a monolithic and a distributed/microservice version of the application because they have concerns about scalability – and they may wish to extend use to partner organisations on a worldwide basis.
Development conditions: Open-source libraries must be used in your development to ensure that the code may be run for its assessment.

<p>Your full brief is to: Create a comprehensive design proposal report, describing your approach to the problem, 
how you will meet the requirements and the design and implementation of the solution.
You should create a working prototype of your design based on a monolithic approach that also has an API which 
can be used to demonstrate a distributed service - via a simple command line (CL) application.</p>
<p>Part 1: The Design Proposal Report
<br>Your team is expected to prepare and deliver a design proposal report of your intended information risk management work for the organisation.
Your report should detail the design decisions and approaches that you have adopted to create your secure software solution. 
It should outline business and technical challenges 
you have identified/ expect to encounter, and then highlight (briefly) what paradigms, patterns, theories and practices 
you intend to utilise on this project. Build up a rationale where appropriate supported by literature.
State any requirements you have gathered, and any assumptions you are making in relation to the design of the system as a consequence 
of your investigation. You should also state any tools and models that you will use in your solution.</p>
		<p> Our team decided to design the system with the NASA domain in mind</p>

			<p>The answer to the question may be viewed here</p>
		<p><li><a href= "ISS_Design.docx" class="button" src= "ISS_Design.docx">Assignment 1</a></li></p>
<p>We successfully passed the assignment, achieving an incredible 95% for the assignment.</p>
		
		
<body>	<p><u> Unit 8 (Design Document)</u></p>
		
		
<p><u>Unit 11 Development Team Project: Coding Output</u></p>
<p>The assignment for this unit required the group to submit the code with regards to the brief outlined in Unit 6.
<br> I have made the file available to view below</p>
