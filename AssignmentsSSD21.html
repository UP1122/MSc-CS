<body>	<p><u> Unit 1-3 (Introduction to Secure software development)</u></p>


<p>This unit started out with a collaborative discussion. The instructions where:</p>
<p>Select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring. 
 Which UML models might you use to present the design of your proposed software, and why are they the most appropriate choice(s)?.</p>
	
	<p>My contribution to the discussion was as follows:</p>
  
 <p>OWASP, the open web application security project is an open source nonprofit foundation to identify and help prevent the most prevalent security 
 risks in todays ever changing information based world. I have chosen to focus on the second most important risk- broken authentication. 
 This method of attack includes but is not limited to compromised passwords, sessions and keys to compromise the system. 
 Many applications use specific error messages when incorrect credentials are entered, thus providing the attacker with 
 information as to how to access the system(“A2:2017-Broken Authentication | OWASP,” n.d.).
 Another such exploit is a brute force attack, which uses computing power to try infinite combinations of username 
 and password to gain access to the system. A useful mitigation against this type of attack is the advent of 
  Multi factor authentication, which requires a secondary time sensitive input in order to access the system.  
  Microsoft estimates that 99.9% of brute force attacks would be thwarted by utilization of MFA(“Microsoft: 99.9% of 
  compromised accounts did not use multi-factor authentication | ZDNet,” n.d.).</p>

<p>Simple measures such as regularly changing passwords, implementing MFA and returning generic 
 error codes may prevent against most broken authentication attacks.</p>

<p>As a summary of the discussion, I posted the following</p>
<p> Over the course of the module, I have delved into research regarding the OWASP top 10, alongside my colleagues. 
 We all have reached similar conclusions as to the risks these vulnerabilities present, as well as ways to mitigate these risks.</p>
<p>With regards to Yohay's post on insufficient logging and monitoring, this is an area that has had a real world impact, 
 such as the Ukrainian power plant intrusion in 2015 (Whitehead et al., 2017). 
 Logging of previous intrusions and subsequent analysis may have assisted engineers in providing updates to patch these 
 vulnerabilities to prevent future breaches. Monitoring systems need to be put in place with regular analytics to detect and fix vulnerabilities.<p>

<p>Alexander's post on sensitive data exposure, allowed me to understand the importance of HTTPS versus standard HTTP. 
 It is also interesting to note that the HTTPS certificate may be obtained for free, thus concluding that all websites 
 containing sensitive data should not have a reason not to use HTTPS (Basques, 2019). It is also advisable not to 
 use public access networks when performing sensitive data operations, as this data may be intercepted, especially when HTTPS is not used. 
 Mitigation techniques include using a VPN and ensuring the site uses SSL encryption (Kaspersky, 2020).</p>

<p>David's post on broken authentication is crucial especially in todays ever changing information based online world. 
 Generic and reused passwords should never be used, as if one site is compromised, all accounts with the same password may be vulnerable. 
 It is also critical to use MFA, as this provides an extra layer of security against such attacks. I have found that google authenticator 
 is very useful in this regard and have applied it to many of my personal applications. A password manager, such as last pass, 
 enables secure storage of difficult to remember passwords. Biometric authentication such as fingerprint or retinal access is perhaps 
 the safest method of access control today, and should be used whenever possible, and always in conjunction with other layers of security (Khan et al., 2015).</p>

<p>IOT advancements mean that a computer chip can be placed in almost anything, and allows for network control, data analysis and overall innovation. 
 This may come at the cost of data security as a trade off for expediency. Start up and legacy companies should be aware of this, 
 and provide all possible measures to ensure data security (Sohoel, Jaatun and Boyd, 2018).</p>

<p>In conclusion, security needs to have a dual approach from the side of the developers as well as the consumers. 
 Developers need to ensure that their code is robust and constantly updated to prevent attacks, 
 while consumers need to be proactive in their security approach, with regards to passwords, MFA and always employing safe browsing techniques.</p>

	<body>	<p><u> Unit 6 (Design Document)</u></p>
		<p>For this assignment we were assigned groups with the following brief:</p>
<p>For this assessment, you are advised to position yourself and your team as IT Software Consultants and Developers.
You are required to develop an application for an organisation with domain-specific requirements. 
A domain refers to a group of users with similar application and hardware requirements. A domain may be characterised by having:
periodic pressure on resources (CPU, storage, or the network)
interactive response requirements between request and reply
substantial data download requirements
Such requirements place specific demands on a system’s operations, and this influences the way that it should be operated and managed.

The API should support access via a web browser and/or a command line application that will allow an authenticated user to download stored data in a read-only format.
The solution should ensure that all privacy and security regulations are met, including those specified by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (ICO, n.d.)
Mechanisms should be deployed to minimise the attack surface of the solution.
The organisation would like to see a monolithic and a distributed/microservice version of the application because they have concerns about scalability – and they may wish to extend use to partner organisations on a worldwide basis.
Development conditions: Open-source libraries must be used in your development to ensure that the code may be run for its assessment.

<p>Your full brief is to: Create a comprehensive design proposal report, describing your approach to the problem, 
how you will meet the requirements and the design and implementation of the solution.
You should create a working prototype of your design based on a monolithic approach that also has an API which 
can be used to demonstrate a distributed service - via a simple command line (CL) application.</p>
<p>Part 1: The Design Proposal Report
<br>Your team is expected to prepare and deliver a design proposal report of your intended information risk management work for the organisation.
Your report should detail the design decisions and approaches that you have adopted to create your secure software solution. 
It should outline business and technical challenges 
you have identified/ expect to encounter, and then highlight (briefly) what paradigms, patterns, theories and practices 
you intend to utilise on this project. Build up a rationale where appropriate supported by literature.
State any requirements you have gathered, and any assumptions you are making in relation to the design of the system as a consequence 
of your investigation. You should also state any tools and models that you will use in your solution.</p>
		<p> Our team decided to design the system with the NASA domain in mind</p>

<p>I successfully passed the assignment, with improvements suggested regarding: Further justification for choices, Increased detail, Further research to support choices
	and neater drawing of diagrams.</p>
		
		


<p><u>Unit 8 (Hands-on with Database Design)</u></p>
<p>The assignment for this unit required us to :
	identify a NoSQL technology to research. Then post in the discussion forum detailing the key approaches of your chosen technology and 
	how its relative merits when compared with a traditional relational database.
Some types of NoSQL you might want to consider include:Graph databases, Key/value stores, Document stores and Object databases</p>	
<p> My contribution to the discussion was as follows:</p>
<p>  Relational database structures, such as sql have been around for many decades, and have a sort of “one size fits all” approach. 
Recently, due to “Big Data”, the nonrelational database structure such as Nosql have become increasingly popular(Wiktorski, 2019). 
It is estimated that 2.5 billion gigabytes of data are generated every day(Kalid et al., 2017).
One such example is Googles Big table. Its stated uses are for IoT, Financial analysis and adtech. It has been proven to be highly efficient as well as increased scalability. 
Bigtable uses a unique key value map store, using a row-key, column-key and timestamp approach(Kalid et al., 2017).  A use case scenario is for financial analysis, 
in collaboration with Dow Jones. The aim was to collate 30 years’ worth of news events with financial implications on businesses, 
small and large(Cloud Bigtable: NoSQL Database Service  |  Google Cloud, n.d.) An example as per the Dow Jones website, is the effect of Hurricanes in 2017, 
on businesses. This data was used to infer relationships between entities and the effects of the hurricanes on those entities(Dow Jones Case Study  |  Google Cloud, n.d.).  
This large amount of data would not be compatible with a traditional sql database due to its unstructured nature.

With the advent of big data, artificial intelligence, IoT and others, as well as non-structural data being generated, big data companies would certainly 
benefit from using nosql databases in certain processes. Sql databases, however, still have a place, especially for businesses dealing with structural data. 
It is unlikely and unwise to assume that there can only be one method, and the “one size fits all” approach cannot apply to the current exponential growth in data generation. 
Businesses would benefit in utilizing both systems for different outcomes.</p>
<p> In response to a collegues post on the Mongodb nosql database, I researched and found the following:</p>
<p>Advantages: Sharding as you had mentioned- Utilizing the power of multiple servers for database distribution and storage(Advantages of MongoDB | Disadvantages of MongoDB - DataFlair, n.d.). 
(An obvious current disadvantage here would be regarding the environmental cost of running many servers, however, when alternative energy sources are used, 
this disadvantage would be not applicable).
Scalability- The horizontally scalable nature of the Mongodb is attractive for growing businesses, allowing them to simply add more servers in order to grow. 
As mentioned previously, Currently the use of fossil fuels would negatively impact the environment when adding more servers. The problem is negated by using renewable energy. 
Speed- Mongodb is said to be 100 times faster than traditional sql databases, resulting in greatly improved performance(Gyorodi et al., 2015).
A disadvantage that I came across related to the limit on the size of files to 16mb. However, given the compression solutions available, I doubt that this 
would be a major problem.(All About MongoDB NoSQL Database: Advantages and Disadvantages, n.d.) 
Overall, it seems to be an impressive nosql database, with many possible applications. I agree with you fully, that traditional sql databases would 
continue to have a place, as well as nosql databases such as   Mongodb, chosen in relation to the design and function of the system</p>
		
<p>As a summary, I posted the following:</p>
<p>During this discussion, I have learnt much about non sql databases. From my own research in googles big table, to other databases explored by my colleagues, 
such as Mongodb and Neo4j. From this research, I can surmise the following:Non sql databases are increasingly being used for unstructured data. 
Some are open source, but many companies have developed their own non sql databases. This leads to the companies achieving a marketplace advantage, 
depending on how user friendly and robust their specific design is.
In addition, the horizontally scalable nature as well as sharding, may lead to improved efficiency and faster request times leading to improved performance. 
It also means that nosql databases are the preferred choice for larger or ever-changing data sets (Sumalatha, Vookanti and Vannala, 2021). 
This may have a determinantal effect on the environment, as more servers lead to increased power usage, so companies that utilize this system, 
should look into renewable energy sources in their system design so as to decrease their use and reliance on fossil fuels.
A performance comparison between mongodb and mysql when using an IoT device, showed similar performance in most areas, however, 
mongodb’s response time was slightly quicker in certain requests, while mysql was more stable. The authors conclude, that depending on the usage required, 
either database may be used for specific purposes. (Rautmare and Bhalerao, 2017)  
With regards to big data, the non schema nature, as well as possibility for dynamic scalability of the no sql database structure, makes it a promising 
choice for some businesses(Venkatraman et al., 2016).
Overall, it is unlikely that all businesses will benefit from switching to nonsql databases, and as such sql should be in use for many years to come.</p>

						
			
<p><u>Unit 11 (Web Development in Python)</u></p>
		<p>For this assignment, we had to implement the previous system design, into a usable solution for an online shopping company
		I successfully developed a system in PyCharm using Python and sqlite as a database storage. I was particularly proud of the outcome
			of this assignment, accomplishing all required parameters and testing the sytem through many iterations
