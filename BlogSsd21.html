<body>	<p><u> Blog Post 1 : "Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security" </u></p>
<p> I fully agree with this statement. People are predictable. People follow a routine. People do the same thing repeatedly. 
  When these factors are thought of, an attacker may be able to take advantage of this knowledge in order to access a system .</p> 

<p>Take authentication for example. People generally forget passwords very easily, and this is understandable, 
  as there are often hundreds of accounts for different services which may be used by a single person. 
  To remember 100 different unique passwords is likely difficult, if not impossible. So the person would use the same password multiple times. 
  This may become a problem if one of the accounts associated with the password is leaked, thus compromising the security of all accounts under the person’s name. 
  This may lead to an authentication failure, whereby an attacker may pose as a person, using the correct credentials, while in fact impersonating the authenticated individual. 
  Mitigation involves the person using different passwords for each service, as well as making them difficult to guess, and not be susceptible to phishing attacks. 
  One such service is LastPass, which securely stores all passwords on your device, behind encryption and biometric access. 
  It also suggests random alphanumeric passwords which are more secure than passwords associated with something in the individual’s life.</p> 

  <p>Monitoring and corrective action go hand in hand. If an engineer has adequate monitoring in place, and detects a breach, corrective 
    action to prevent the event from occurring again should be taken. These are measures that must be done by people, and a failure to do so, 
    results in a risk to cyber security.</p> 

  <p>Competency is also an important factor, for example, if the engineer developing a system is not competent, or up to date with their knowledge, 
    the entire system is at risk. Mitigation involves thoroughly assessing prospective employees, as well as instituting multiple review processes.</p>
  
<p>In conclusion, people are the biggest risk to cyber security today, and both the consumer and developers have a role to play in addressing this.
  I do however hope that machine learning and artificial intelligence may be used in the future to adequately protect against threats, 
  decreasing the cyber security risk of human error.</p>
