<body>	<p><u> Reflection OOIS 2021 </u></p>
<p> 

<u>Unit 1:</u></p>
<p>This unit introduced me to the concept of a system development lifecycle. Data is everywhere but is useless without meaning. 
To turn the vast amount of data into something usable, we must find meaning in the data, which results in information. This then allows 
us to gain knowledge from the data and create solutions to problems around us.
If any of these steps are not followed correctly, we may end up designing functions that are not necessary to our system. 
Conversely, if we do not understand the system requirements, we may omit important features which may result in our program being obsolete. This unit made me aware of how much data is being transmitted and used every day by every person, and how we need to learn to utilize the data, not for financial gain, but for improving humanity. For example, using the vast amounts of data collected in the cancer sphere over the past 50 years, may assist us in developing targeted therapies, instead of the current “nuclear” drugs available, which have a terrible effect on patients(Kettering, 2015).
The collaborative discussion was interesting to me, as it directly reflected an issue I had with the South African Revenue Service just a few weeks prior.</p> 

<p><u>Unit 2:</u></p>
<p>The required reading for this unit introduced me to information systems, which was mostly general knowledge. Of interest, was 
reading about the progression from the “mainframe pc” to the web, to web 2.0 to where we are today. It really is a great example of human 
perseverance and ingenuity. I also found Moores law interesting, where the number of integrated circuits on a chip doubles every 2 years. 
More astounding is Huangs law, which states that GPU’s advance at an even faster rate.</p>  

<p><u>Unit 3:</u></p>
<p>This unit focused on the fundamentals of object orientated design, including concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, 
and polymorphism amongst others. This was a challenging concept to understand. Especially with regards to how to apply them 
in python programming. I always find, that when I am struggling to understand something, I should research the benefits of the system that 
I am studying. As a result, I found that Object oriented systems generally are able to predict the reliability and maintainability of the system, 
thus making them necessary to good programming methods(Brito e Abreu & Melo, 1996).</p>

<p><u>Unit 4:</u></p>
<p>I started the Codio exercises, relating to classes and objects. Very difficult to pick up. I felt that the exercises 
provided where not too informative regarding errors. This is one of the areas which I will need to practice over and over to master it. 
I have identified a mini course relating to this area and will be completing it soon.</p> 

<p><u>Unit 5:</u></p>
<p>Started working on UML. Also a difficult aspect of the module. I further researched its use, and found that it was not widely used by 
developers, with most stating no usage, a few stating use for client interaction, and some using it to satisfy management demands(Petre, 2013). 
To me, it seems like this area is just one of the types of textbook usage, with little value in reality. However, I finally understood the
concept of multiplicity, which had stumped me for the last week.</p> 

<p><u>Unit 6:</u></p>
<p>In this unit, I continued with the codio exercises, as well as learnt more about UML. </p>

<p><u>Unit 7:</u></p> 
<p>In this unit, I focused on the first assignment, which was to create several diagrams relating to an online shopping design. 
I tried a number of data modelling software systems, eventually using Visual Paradigm. </p>

<p><u>Unit 8:</u></p>
<p>This unit focused on database design in mysql, as well as alternatives to an sql database structure. I contributed to the 
collaborative discussion with information relating to Googles Big Table, which I found interesting, as well as their collaboration 
with Dow Jones to track newspaper events over 30 years and their impact on businesses. This sort of data would not be able to be stored 
in an sql database, due to its unstructured data. I also learnt more about Mongodb and Neo4j from my colleagues, and did further research 
into Mongodb, as mentioned in the “Assignments” page on my github account.</p>

<p><u>Unit 9:</u></p>
<p>This unit included a revision of sql databases, which I am relatively comfortable using. An interesting fact about sql which I came
across in my research, was that sql was created in 1974!(Chamberlin, 2012). This is many years before the idea of the internet was envisioned. </p>

<p><u>Unit 10:</u></p>
<p>This unit was a continuation of database implementation, which proved surprisingly difficult. I did however, manage to 
become acclimated to it by completing the system design project.</p>

<p><u>Unit 11:</u></p>
<p>We had to submit our system implementation code for the online shopping system. This proved a truly herculean task, with 
literally hundreds of hours spent coding. It was also the most informative, and rewarding aspect of this module, and even though it was
extremely difficult, it was a task that I thoroughly enjoyed. My code drew data from an sqlite database. I developed it in PyCharm, as 
I found the codio interface lacking, and not very user friendly. Pycharm advised me of when there was an error in the code, and as such, made 
it easier to fix. I struggled with adding to a shopping cart and having the totals calculated. Also a big issue was learning to connect to, and
draw data from my database once the tables had been created. However,  at the end, my code was usable, and robust. It might not be elegant, or 
concise, but it worked, and worked well. I only hope that I will not be penalized for not writing the code in codio. I have learnt from my 
errors during the numerous iterations of code, and am confident that in future projects, I will be able to write the code much more quickly and 
concisely. I learnt the value of good time management and will apply this to my life in general in the future.</p>

<p><u>Unit 12:</u></p>
<p>In this unit, we had to update the e-portfolio, (which I admit, I have been slacking in). In my first module, the creation of 
the e-portfolio was tough, with me not being able to understand much of the code, and where to add descriptions etc. However, I was pleasantly 
surprised to note that my experiences in coding have not gone to waste, with me being able to add to and modify my e-portfolio with ease, even 
adding buttons and separate files without any problems. I have vowed in future to regularly update the e-portfolio. I also wrote my first blog post,
relating to a company I have an interest in. My final addition was to add this reflection to my portfolio.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed this course, specifically the system implementation of an online shopping system, as I feel that this area would be 
most beneficial for me in the future, to bring my ideas to fruition.</p>
