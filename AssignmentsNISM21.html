<body>	<p><u> Unit 1-3 (Introduction to Network and Information Security Management)</u></p>


<p>This unit started out with a collaborative discussion. The instructions where:</p>
<p>Select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring. 
 Which UML models might you use to present the design of your proposed software, and why are they the most appropriate choice(s)?</p>

<p>Unit 4</p>
<p>The focus of this unit was using basic tools to identify information available from a website.</p>
<p> 
<br> Our teams outputs relating to the tests were as follows</p>

<body>	<p><u> Unit 6 (Design Document)</u></p>
		<p>For this assignment we were assigned groups with the following brief:</p>
<p>Your team (the vulnerability test team) will need to produce a design document/proposal that promotes the benefit of what you will be doing for the business.
You will need to provide the following:
<br>A list of the tools you will use, justifications for why you selected the tools.
<br>The methodology you will use.
<br>A list of any (potential) impacts on normal operations caused by using the tools.
<br>A list of assumptions and limitations of the tools and outputs produced.
<br>A timeline for the completion of your task.

<p>Our teams design proposal is available to view below</p>

<body>	<p><u> Unit 8: Cryptography and Its Use in Operating Systems</u></p>
<p>TrueCrypt was a popular and well-respected operating system add-on that could create encrypted 
volumes on a Windows and/or Linux system. In addition, it was also designed to create a complete, 
bootable volume that could encrypt the entire operating system and data for a Windows XP system. It was discontinued in 2014.
Case Study: Read the TrueCrypt cryptanalysis by Junestam & Guigo (2014) (link is in the reading list) and then answer the following questions:
<br>The (anonymous) TrueCrypt authors have said “Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues” (http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/, 2014). Does the cryptanalysis provided above prove or disprove this assumption?
<br>Would you be prepared to recommend TrueCrypt to a friend as a secure storage environment? What caveats (if any) would you add?</p>

<p><u>Unit 11 Development Team Project: Coding Output</u></p>
<p>The assignment for this unit required the group to submit the code with regards to the brief outlined in Unit 6.
<br> I have made the file available to view below</p>
<p><li><a href= "IssProjectSubmission.zip" class="button" src= "IssProjectSubmission.zip">Assignment 2 zip</a></li></p>
	

<p><u>Unit 11: Future trends in Secure Software Development</p></u>
<p>The final component of the module focused on a debate, the topic being:
<br>“Torvalds has been proven wrong and it only took nearly thirty years. Microservices and microkernels are the future. “
<br>On the forum post a message either agreeing or disagreeing with the above and give a justification (ideally with an academic reference) supporting your view.</p>
<p> My contribution to the debate was as follows:</p>
<p><li><a href= "Debate - Microservices and Microkernels.pdf" class="button" src= "Debate - Microservices and Microkernels.pdf">Debate - Microservices and Microkernels</a></li></p>
