<body>	<p><u> Reflection on Software Engineering Project Management </u></p>

  
<p>The purpose of this module was to examine the differences in software engineering project management with the 
usual definition of project management in other sectors. 

<p>The module started with a collaborative discussion on failures of software projects and their causes. 
 During my research, I discovered that the main causes of software failures could be attributed to people 
(inadequate skills and communication), tasks (poor understanding of expectations and requirements) and methods 
(size and skill of team assigned to the project). Of note is the Ariane 5 rocket disaster (Jazequel and Meyer, 1997), 
which failed in large part due to incompatible components being used and a lack of adequate testing to identify and rectify these issues. 
Other similar cases point to the fact that this is not an isolated incident(Nelson, 2007). My opinion derived from these cases, 
was that communication is likely to be the single greatest factor influencing software failures. Insufficient engagement between 
the customer and developers may cause unrealistic expectations by the customer and the business not meeting requirements. 
Miscommunication or communication breakdown between internal teams leads to budget overruns, unusable software, and overall failure.</p> 

<p>Our group project had begun. We assigned roles to each of our members, with my assigned role being in the 
customer engagement sector. Myself and my colleague- David, were instructed to retrieve the requirements from 
the other team for our developers, as well as propose our requirements as customers.  I was introduced to the gherkin 
language, which is a non-technical code, used by the developers to create user acceptance tests, which may be automated 
to continuously test the code to ensure that it works. The added benefit is to communicate the usability of the code to the 
customers in a relatable manner. I found this to be an invaluable exercise which we used in our own group project. </p>

  
<p>The next stage in this journey was to evaluate different development models, such as agile and waterfall. 
I delved further into whether the waterfall approach should ever be used, and I found that while it is considered a “simple” model, 
its inherent drawbacks as to set requirements and resistance to change means that it is rarely appropriate for software development 
in our ever-changing environment. Research showed that scrum, a type of agile methodology was the most utilized model in the software 
engineering industry, with more than 50% of companies employing the methodology (Vallon et al., 2018). Of interest, I discovered that
an increasing number of companies are moving towards a hybrid waterfall agile approach, which is likely to become the industry norm in 
the years to come (Kuhrmann et al., 2017).</p>

<p>I was introduced to JIRA, a project tracking software, which I had never used before. Despite this, it proved quite
easy and intuitive to use. It is understandable that over 80% of the fortune 500 companies use JIRA during development 
(Who uses Jira? | Atlassian, 2022). Once we had settled on our requirements for the game, we met with the opposing 
team to direct them to create the game that we envisioned, with their team doing the same for us. I learnt an important aspect 
of the business world- negotiation! Fortunately, our opposing team were very accommodating, and fostered good communication. 
This was needed for the success of the project. We successfully submitted the design proposal and continued with the actual development of the game.</p>

<p>Our cohort was introduced to the importance of UX in development. I found that the CUE model as proposed by (Minge and Thüring, 2018), 
was outdated, excluding the important component of immersion. Research shows that immersion is important to customers in the post pandemic 
era, and may not necessarily require virtual reality, but could be implemented using 3D models, haptic feedback, audio and interaction. 
Virtual reality, or simply 3D modelling showed an improved customer engagement rate in an online shopping environment (Papagiannidis et al., 2017). 
Further studies indicate a positive effect of immersion resulting in an increased feel of realism and therefore improved engagement (Shin, 2019). 
I feel that this may be a crucial factor affecting user engagement in other sectors in the future. Businesses need to adapt their operating models 
to include these components to remain competitive.</p>
  
<p>Our team continued with our game production, with numerous late-night meetings, owing to the time difference between members.
Incidentally, geographic and temporal differences between team members are one of the causes of development failure (Malik et al., 2018). 
We completed the initial stages of the game, with a focus on five of the other team’s requirements. 
We were simultaneously exposed to budget estimations as well as risk analysis. I found that the outdated method of 
counting lines of code was rightfully discontinued. Algorithmic methods of estimating budgets interested me, and I spent multiple hours discovering 
the different methods of calculating budgets using software. Eventually, we decided that as the industry norm is “expert opinion”, we 
would be using this to estimate our budget in the group project. I found numerous issues with this method, such as the fact that none
of our members were “experts”, as well as the fact that we had very little project management between us. I discovered an interesting 
article researching the possibility of utilizing modified machine learning for estimating the budget of a development. 
The researchers concluded that their experiment was a success, with improvement in calculation times when compared to current machine 
learning techniques (Sreekanth et al., 2022). Further study needs to be conducted, but the idea of deep modified machine learning 
for estimation will likely prove effective in the future, owing to the accuracy, speed, lower cost, and objectivity that the system offers.</p>
  
  
<p>The presentation component proved tricky, as we had to record a voice over, explaining our progress, as well as recording a 
visualization of the code in use. Fortunately, a few of our members were quite adept at compiling and editing the video, 
resulting in a presentation we were immensely proud of.</p>
  
<p>The final task of the module was to identify a trend that we believe would be the most important in the future. 
Our team chose blockchain technology. I am extremely interested in the blockchain for its ability to redesign the financial system(Nguyen, 2016).
However, this is not the only use for blockchain. In my research, I found applications for supply chain management(Queiroz, Telles and Bonilla, 2020), 
healthcare(Wong, Yee and Nøhr, 2018), accounting (Kwilinski, 2019) and food supply (Lin et al., 2020) to name a few.  
The potential of this technology is akin to the change that occurred when the internet became widely available. 
Blockchain technology incorporates inherent “trust” which is largely absent when individuals deal with each other, 
or middlemen such as banks are relied upon(Casey M. J. and Vina P., 2018). I strongly believe that blockchain 
technology will underpin the technology sector over the next decade.</p>
