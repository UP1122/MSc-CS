<body>	<p><u> Reflection SSD 2021 </u></p>


<p><u>Unit 1</p></u>
<p>In this unit, we continued with UML, which was a focus of the previous module. 
 We also learnt about the different development models, such as waterfall and agile. 
 We also delved into the OWASP top 10 security risks. Groups were assigned, and we all had to 
 sign a team contract to ensure equitable distribution of tasks. I found this to be a novel approach to 
 team work, ensuring that team members are accountable and perform well. I wonder if this sort of 
 contract may be applied to businesses to improve productivity.</p> 

<p><u>Unit 2</p></u>
<p>In this unit, we continued the discussion forum. 
Our team, The Ambassadors met multiple times to discuss our plans for the team project. 
We decided on the features to be included in the NASA project, namely resource management, accounts and exercise features.
We also individually contributed to a blog post, relating to whether people are a risk to cyber security. 
I agreed with the statement, citing multiple sources of people interfering or risking cyber security. 
This type of security risk has occurred in my own family, whereby a family member unknowingly fell 
victim to a scam relating to divulging personal information which resulted in an account being hacked. 
This sort of attack would have been mitigated by knowledge of cyber security, resulting in the attacker being unable to access the account.</p> 

<p>Unit 3</p>
<p>This unit focused on programming languages, which culminated in an interesting team discussion relating to Python. 
I personally found that programming languages are only as secure as the design of the code and the proactive measures 
put in place by the developers. 
Our team meetings were productive. We set a date for us to complete the design document, 
which was before the due date, thus giving us enough time to complete the programming aspects of the assignment. 
I was tasked with completing UML diagrams relating to accounts.</p> 

<p><u>Unit 4</p></u>
<p>In this unit, we focused on programming language concepts. I learnt about regular expressions REGEX, as well as evil REGEX and ReDos attacks.
Our team meetings were very productive, as well as our meeting with our tutor Dr Peoples. 
We discussed the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the project. 
Our next task was to make logging and secure channels more prominent in the UML diagrams.</p>

<p><u>Unit 5</u></p>

<p>This unit’s theme was about testing. We explored concepts such as cyclomatic complexity amongst others.
Our team meetings were informative and productive, resulting in completion of our system design project
I personally focused on the GDPR concerns relating to our NASA project. This area is a very boring subject, but is highly necessary to protect personal information.</p> 

<p><u>Unit 6</u></p>
<p>This unit was about linters in python. I learnt a lot about the different types of testing, 
 as well as some of pythons linters such as flake8 and pylint. I tested these out in the codio exercises. 
 We also submitted our team design project for marking. We started development of the code to be used for our final 
 group submission. Unfortunately around this time, one of our team members left the module due to personal reasons.</p> 

<p><u>Unit 7</u></p>
<p>We delved into Operating systems in this unit. 
Our team meetings produced impressive progression in the development of our code. 
I was assigned the task of implementing multi factor authentication into our code. After much research, 
I decided to use “Authy” as a provider for MFA. This was due to authy providing the only free service, 
when all other providers were paid services. The caveat to this, was that authy was a trial service, 
with reduced functions compared to the full service. 
I successfully integrated our code with the authy integration . When a user attempts to login, 
the user is prompted to enter a 7 digit unique code from authy, which changes every 20 seconds. 
I found this to be a very useful and comprehensive security feature,  having used the service as a consumer for online account purposes.</p> 

<p><u>Unit 8</u></p>
<p>In this unit, the team focused on assembling the code. My task was to implement the cryptography feature, 
specifically encryption and decryption. I used a symmetric encryption key for this. 
We decided to encrypt the passwords before sending to and storing in the SQL database. 
This added an additional security feature, in that if the database was ever compromised, 
our passwords would be secure, as the attacker would likely not know the private key to decrypt the passwords.
For me, this was a challenging aspect of the code, but extremely satisfying once it worked. 
One of the issues that I was having included the decrypted password being returned in the bytes format, 
with a “b” before the encrypted password. This meant that the cryptography function couldn’t decipher the byte format. 
This required the password being converted into a string using the .decode function. Fortunately, this was successful.</p>

<p><u>Unit 9</u></p>
<p>I discovered an interesting open-source vulnerability assessment from pyup.io, 
which records and compares all known vulnerabilities with python libraries and packages. 
The free version is updated every month, but a paid version is updated as and when a new vulnerability is discovered. 
We successfully integrated it into our project.
Unfortunately, at this stage, we had to disable the Authy MFA due to conflicts generated when coding. 
The team thought that the issue was due to the Authy program license being a trial and therefore, 
did not have full functionality. We had to make a decision to abandon Authy usage and instead use a simple email MFA. 
This was particularly unfortunate, as an email MFA is probably the least secure MFA available. 
This is due to the insecure nature of emailed MFAs, risk of phishing, and other vulnerabilities 
that are addressed in an API based MFA. It should be known that in an ideal situation, a service such as 
 Authy, Google authenticator or Duo should be used, however due to this being a hypothetical exercise, 
concessions had to be made.</p>

<p><u>Unit 10</u></p>
            
<p>During this unit, we learnt about developing an API for a distributed environment. 
We also contributed to the discussion about the TrueCrypt full disk encryption. One of my 
classmates proposed that even though there were security vulnerabilities, she would still 
recommend TrueCrypt to a friend due to these flaws being considered low risk. I disagree with this, 
since the software has reached end of life, resulting in no further updates being provided since 2015. 
This coupled with the fact that the developers themselves recommend an alternative software and the 
original repository preventing downloads of the source code mean that it is certainly not a safe software 
to use and should be discouraged. Any source code available may have been altered from the original and 
may include malicious code fragments which may perform functions different to those advertised. 
In the seminar for this unit, we presented our project to the lecturers and our colleagues. 
I felt that we were particularly successful in this endeavor, due to our concise presentation, strong code base and professional delivery.</p>
            
<p><u>Unit 11</u></p>
            
<p>In this unit, we participated in a debate on whether microservices and microkernels are the future. 
I agree with this due to the fact that monolithic structures have security flaws which are not present 
or pose a low severity in a microservice architecture. We also submitted our team project, of which we 
are extremely proud of. We certainly achieved all the objectives detailed. 
I truly enjoyed working on this project with my team members. 
Each of them are highly skilled in their own fields and bring a wealth of experience and knowledge. 
This has allowed us to integrate different ideas into a successful project.</p> 

<p><u>Unit 12</u></p>
<p>We have reached the end of the module, with a final take away thought on how to 
 approach system architecture in a distributed world. This module has been so interesting, 
opening my eyes to the different types of security flaws, and risks. I have learnt to apply safe practices in my own life, 
as well as educating family members as to best practices. People are the biggest risks to cyber security today and educating 
them as well as providing appropriate corrective instruction are critical to prevent future intrusions.</p>
