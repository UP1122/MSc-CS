									<h2><a href="#"> </a>Trying to make a better world.</h2>
									<p> Around 2018, whilst listening to music, specifically "These days" by Jess Glynne, I was 
		  particularly moved by one line in the song, "Too young to feel this old". This line essentially summed up how I felt about my life at that point.
										
		  I am a South African trained Dentist (University of the Witwatersrand), currenly working in the public sector. I have become highly
                  skilled in Oral surgery, specifically surgical extractions, biopsies and surgical removal of oral lesions.
                  I quickly grew "bored" with general dentistry, leading me to pursue other avenues. Public Health was one of these avenues.
                  With rampant inequality in South Africa, and extensive corruption, the health sector is in dire straits. My belief is that gaining more knowledge 
                  in Public Health, would allow me to contribute to changing this system. In September 2019, I enrolled in the Master of Public Health program at 
                  the University of Sheffield. To date, I have completed all 8 of the required modules, with 4 distinctions. I have successfully completed my dissertation:                 
                  A Systematic Review of Screening for Oral Lesions. I have been very fortunate to be assigned experienced, highly educated and
                  highly accomplished supervisors from the University of Sheffield, International Association for Research on Cancer (IARC)
                  and the World Health Organization (WHO). My dissertation has been graded, and I fortunately achieved a distinction!! I have graduated from my MPH with distinction and 
		  am excited as to what the future holds!!</p>
									
		  <p> In 2020, I decided to embark on one of my dreams, after much deliberation- studying Computer Science. I have always been "good" with computers, 
		  and enjoyed assembling and upgrading computers for my family and friends. I always wanted to learn more, specifically programming. 
		  I developed an interest in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Blockchain technology. It struck me, that computers abide by pure logic.
		  A code that does exactly what you tell it to do, no more, no less. Right vs Wrong, there is no "grey area" when it comes to computers.
		  Automating tasks, decentralizing finances, these areas could greatly improve life for the vast majority of the world, without avenues for 
		  human interference. Technological advances have exponentially improved lives since they were invented. 
		  I decided that while I am still young and healthy to pursue a second Masters degree, this time in Computer Science. I was fortunate to be 
		  accepted to study at the University of Essex. And that is where my Computer Science journey begins. Working full time and studying two Masters
		  degrees is certainly not easy, and many bumps along the way are expected. My hope is to join the vastly different sectors of Health and IT,
		  to make a better system. What is that system? I honestly cant say at this point, but the work is in progress, and one day, I will figure it out
		  Till then, all I can do, is MOVE FORWARD!!</p>
