<body>	<p><u> Reflection on Research Methods and Professional Practice </u></p>

  
 

  <p>Unit 1</p>
<p>The first unit in this module started with an introduction to the different types of reasoning- deductive and inductive. 
<br>Reading through Weisberger and Bradford, 2021, I discovered that there was actually a third type of reasoning, abductive. 
<br>This hybrid reasoning model incorporates both deductive and inductive reasoning, whereby the researcher starts with a set of 
observations, and creates the hypothesis based on the most likely explanation for the data. Interestingly, this type of reasoning is most 
<br>commonly used in the medical field, where practitioners make conclusions based on test results (Weisberger and Bradford, 2021). 
<br>Our cohort had also started the first collaborative discussion, investigating hypothetical cases relating to ethics and professional conduct. 
<br>I chose the case of the medical implant device company- Corazon. I was exposed to the ACM (Acm.org, 2018) and BCS codes of conduct (BCS, 2021), which I had not come across before. 
<br>This proved interesting, and my impression of Corazon was that they had followed all procedures and acted ethically. 
<br>If only more companies could act in this manner!</p> 

  <p>Unit 2</p>
<p>During this unit, I mostly focused on the literature review preparation. Due to my healthcare background and work experience, I chose the use of information systems to transform the healthcare sector in South Africa. 
<br>I am deeply concerned by the state of healthcare in south Africa, and my research has confirmed that utilizing 
information systems can effect a positive change. The lack of IT education by healthcare managers has caused the 
healthcare sector to lag behind other sectors in transformation. 
<br>I hope that I can use my knowledge in both fields to improve healthcare for all parties involved.</p>

  
<p>Unit 3<p/>
<p>Having completed a previous master’s degree, I was fairly competent in my knowledge of research designs. 
<br>I subsequently spent most of the unit contributing to the collaborative discussion. Of interest, was the prevalence of 
<br>dark UX patterns, which would be noticeably present in social media platforms, whereby the objective of the company is 
<br>to keep the user scrolling (Cara, 2019). I was amazed to find out that I had fallen victim to multiple dark 
<br>UX patterns in the form of misdirection or misleading adverts designed to increase revenue. 
<br>I would hope that more oversight would be implemented in the future to prevent this type of abuse. 
<br>It is however encouraging that authors have identified the critical need for further research to be conducted, 
<br>which may lead to tighter regulation (Runge et al., 2022).</p>

  <p>Unit 4</p>
<p>This unit focused on the different types of research methods, namely quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. 
<br>I researched the strengths and weaknesses of the qualitative methods, with my conclusion being that an in-depth 
interview was preferable to a focus group in most situations. 
<br>A significant drawback is that extroverted members 
in a focus group would propose their opinions more forcefully, while the introverted members would wish to avoid 
confrontation, and would not accurately voice their opinion (ZAPFL, 2018). 
<br>The experience of the moderator is of crucial importance, and would greatly impact the quality of the focus group (Smithson, 2000). 
<br>Focus groups can be effective when used in conjunction with other data collection methods, such as quantitative studies, or follow up individual interviews (Rauf et al., 2014).</p>

  <p>Unit 5</p>
<p>This unit introduced us to survey and interview designs. Further research into this domain concluded 
<br>that effective design leads to decreased errors and increased accuracy, which affects the validity of the conclusions reached, 
making this a critical exercise (Sanchez, 1992). </p>
  
  <p>Unit 6</p>
<p>During this unit, the masters students were encouraged to reach out to potential supervisors of our dissertation. 
<br>This was a disappointing experience, having not received feedback or communication from either of the 
two supervisors contacted. <br>I would have liked to discuss potential projects, but this was not possible.</p>
  
  
  <p>Unit 7</p>
<p>We had submitted our literature review and commenced with the second collaborative discussion. 
<br>The topic of this discussion was the ethical obligations of a researcher to a parent company. 
<br>I was disappointed by many of my peers opinions that multiple analyses could be conducted to paint 
the company in a more positive light. 
<br>This may have been impacted by the wording of the question, 
which could be improved. <br>I strongly stated my case that the researcher should report the findings based on 
<br>the correct methodology regardless of whether the results arrive at a negative conclusion. 
<br>This opinion was not shared by the majority of my colleagues unfortunately.</p>
  
  <p>Unit 8</p>
<p>This unit focused on hypothesis testing methodologies and incorporated multiple exercises. 
<br>I found these particularly engaging, having never previously used Excel to conduct these tests before. 
<br>While successful, I feel that IBM SPSS would be a more suitable program with which to conduct hypothesis testing. 
<br>Nevertheless, this was an informative exercise.</p>
  
  
<p>Unit 9</p>
<p>This unit, like unit 8, focused on exercises in analysing data. Again, Excel was used, 
<br>which in this case, proved completely suitable and useful in creating bar graphs and histograms. 
<br>I encountered an interesting case in Exercise 9, which required us to compare and analyse two separate histograms. 
<br>This was not a suitable comparison to me, as the scales were different, and should not be analysed in its current form. 
<br>More useful metrics such as means should be used, making the graphs a needless exercise (Slutsky, 2014). 
<br>A more suitable comparison was introduced later which plotted the entire data set on a single graph. 
<br>As the scale was correct, an accurate comparison could be made.

  
  <p>Unit 10</p> 
<p>This unit culminated in the submission of the research protocol presentation. 
<br>This proved to be a herculean task, having to record a voice narrated PowerPoint presentation. 
<br>I chose a mixed methods analysis, evaluating the opinion of the potential for blockchain technology for 
use in electronic healthcare records management, from the perspectives of healthcare workers in south Africa. 
<br>The rationale being that this type of research tends to increase the validity and reliability of the results (Zohrabi, 2013). 
<br>I am extremely interested and energized by the potential of blockchain technology, specifically in south Africa, where 
corruption and inequality are rampant. Numerous studies confirm the opinion that blockchain improves security and accountability, 
and if used correctly, can reduce inequality(Agbo, Mahmoud and Eklund, 2019; Mayer, da Costa and Righi, 2020; Fang et al., 2021). 
<br>I hope to continue with research in this domain for my dissertation project.</p>

  <p>Unit 11 and 12</p>
<p>The final units were used to complete the e-portfolio and conclude the module. 
<br>Research methods is undoubtably a critical module which contributes to effective and impactful research. 
<br>However, it also impact non-academic areas, by implementing a methodological approach to projects and 
<br>improving communication and writing styles (Earley, 2014).</p>
