									<h2><a href="#"> </a>A reflection of my time studying Network and Information Security Management</h2>
									
						
<body>	<p><u> Reflection NISM 2021 </u></p>


<p><u>Unit 1</p></u>
<p>For the first 4 weeks of the module, I was very preoccupied, as I was completing a dissertation for my Masters in Public Health degree. Fortunately, I accomplished this task (and achieved a distinction!), allowing me to refocus on the MSc CS course properly from Unit 6 onwards. 
This module began with the basics around information security management.  As a complete novice in this area, I was a little apprehensive around accomplishing the objectives for the module. I did some additional research, and found a very easy to understand blog post relating to the basics (Raggad, 2020). This put my mind at ease substantially. We were assigned groups with which we were expected to complete the required assignments. I was happy to be assigned to a group with a colleague that I had worked with in the previous module. 
I contributed to a discussion relating to compromising medical equipment. In my research, I found that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, mass production of ventilation equipment was needed. The companies producing these machines may not all have introduced adequate security measures. Subsequently, a study found that these machines could be penetrated and prevented from supplying the requisite oxygen supply to the patient. This is a catastrophic flaw that a malicious actor may take advantage of (Burke and Saxena, 2021). I also discovered a novel method of securing implantable medical devices using an IMD shield or “communications cloaker” (Zheng et al., 2017). 
</p> 

<p><u>Unit 2</p></u>
<p>This unit introduced us to the STRIDE and DREAD tools for vulnerability assessment. I discovered an interesting document released by the OWASP  foundation, relating to web application security testing (Drake, 2020). Unfortunately, I did not delve deeper into this document until much later in the module. If I had perused the document earlier, our team would have been far more effective. In future, I plan to make a reminder to read documents I feel are important, especially during times of high stress, as it is very easy to forget. 
Our team met to discuss the plans to complete the design document. 
</p> 

<p><u>Unit 3</p></u>
<p>During this unit, I participated in the ongoing collaborative discussion relating to compromised networked medical devices. Our team met multiple times to discuss the design document. I also set up the required AWS educate account and website. This proved to be challenging as I kept returning an error. Fortunately, it appears that I was not alone in struggling to set it up, and my colleagues helpfully provided me with a solution to the problem. .</p> 

<p><u>Unit 4</p></u>
<p>In this unit, I learned more about the OSI model. I spent a bit of time using the common networking tools, such as dig, whois, ping and traceroute. Our team met again to discuss our design proposal. We decided to use the harvester tool to evaluate any personal information from the target site. Nmap would be used to gain any information about ports and vulnerabilities (Makino and Klyuev, 2015). </p>

<p><u>Unit 5</u></p>

<p>During this unit, our team conducted some basic vulnerability tests against the target website. This proved particularly challenging, as our results were largely inconclusive. Very little meaningful data could be gleaned from our tests, probably due to the poor setup of the site. We were unsure as to whether we were on the right track, and I feel that this part of the module could be improved. Perhaps using a university set up site with known vulnerabilities could better provide us with practical application knowledge as opposed to using a poorly constructed site with no content. </p> 

<p><u>Unit 6</u></p>
<p>We submitted the team design document. At first glance, we thought that we had addressed all of the requirements of the assessment. Unfortunately, upon receiving feedback, it appeared that we had not produced an adequate document, owing to our group not understanding and following the requisite checklist. We, as a group, committed to working harder and better to improve our submissions. The first step in this improvement was to completely understand the objectives and outcomes. </p> 

<p><u>Unit 7</u></p>
<p>In this unit, I started using Kali Linux. Initially this was a challenge, as I struggled to run the OS in a virtual environment. Fortunately, after a bit of research, I managed to get it up and running in a VMWare virtual environment. I started using some of the tools and was amazed by the sheer volume of applications available. For my own experience, I ran the aircrack-ng app on my own wireless network and was amazed to find out how weak my own network security was! Needless to say, this has been improved by using some of the techniques found in my research, the first of which was to change the routers default password! (Olagunju and Seedorf, 2011; Pimple et al., 2020). </p> 

<p><u>Unit 8</u></p>
<p>In this unit, we focused on GDPR and examined a few case studies. Our team also met a few times to continue with our executive summary. We ran a few more tests on the target site. I learnt a great deal about the PCI DSS, and how it applies to companies processing payments (PCISSC, 2018). I feel that together with GDPR, a comprehensive regulatory approach will be achieved, and improved security will be the outcome for all.</p>

<p><u>Unit 9</u></p>
<p>In this unit, we delved into logging and monitoring. We also learnt about forensics. I was interested by the windows application: sysinternals, and found it fascinating (the few chapters that I could read for free)(Halsey, 2016). I feel that this book would be good to purchase in the future. The salient points are always check for hidden processes, check storage usage, and always monitor the logs, even as a home user.</p>

<p><u>Unit 10</u></p>
            
<p>In this unit, we concentrated on some of the biggest data breaches of the 21st century. I chose to research Yahoo, and made some startling discoveries, one of which, is that I may have been a victim of a data breach! To date, I have not been contacted regarding the breach by Yahoo. Subsequently, I have of course stopped using Yahoo, and armed with my GDPR knowledge, requested my data be removed from the Yahoo database. Our team met again and after a discussion with our tutor, and armed with the understanding of the assessment, launched into completing the assignment.</p>
            
<p><u>Unit 11</u></p>
            
<p>During this unit, we completed and submitted the executive summary. This was the culmination of many hours of team meetings and discussions. I felt particularly proud of what we had produced, especially when compared to the initial design document. The team showed a magnanimous improvement in the quality of work. I feel that this was largely due to us taking the time to fully understand the objectives and taking a step-by-step approach to completing it. The team worked well together, allowing good communication and respecting individual opinions and experiences, thus fostering an environment of creativity and productivity. I do however feel that earlier reading of the OWASP web application security testing guide, which I had found earlier, would have reduced the workload on the team towards the end. I feel that I need to address my time management skills, and have added this to my action plan. </p> 

<p><u>Unit 12</u></p>
<p>During the final unit of the module, our team met to discuss the topic for the final seminar. Our subject related to CCN- Content concentric networking. I had never heard of this type of network before and was amazed by its possibilities. When a request is made, content is sent from the host. With CCN, the data is stored in caches on routers and nodes, so if a similar request is made, the content is sent from the node instead of the host network providing the requested content again. This would be especially useful in developing countries, where network infrastructure is not as advanced, speeds are limited, and coverage is poor (Singh, Bansal and Sofat, 2014). Bandwidth consumption would reduce, and more bandwidth would be available for use. I feel the only barrier would be privacy and confidentiality (Badsha et al., 2018). Research is being done, and I hope to be able to assist in finding a solution to this revolutionary way of networking. </p>
