									<h2><a href="#"> </a>Launching into Computer Science.</h2>
									<p> The first module out of a total of 6 in the Computer Science degree
										
This module started of with an overview of Computer Systems. As much as I already knew about computers, I was truly blown away by the level of thought and 
design that went into building this system that is used every day. When we start a computer and log into windows, it seems really simple on the surface, 
but so amazingly complex when understanding how it works. It truly is a marvel of human engineering. 
										
Starting with coding was difficult, yet surprisingly rewarding, especially when the code works!! When it didnt, finding out why it wasnt working was 
an intense, yet interesting process. Mostly, it took many, many iterations of code to work, but, practice makes perfect!! Perfection certainly wont come
quickly or easily, only with hard work and determination.</p>

</body>	<p> Unit 1- This unit started out with the creation of this e-portfolio. This proved to be an exceptionally difficult task, given that I had no experience in html.
However, after many hours of testing, researching and modifying, my site was up! It did not look great, but I had achieved the task. A note to take into account 
(Which I was not aware of, and resulted in much frustration) was that after comitting a code, there is a slight delay, from the time of the commit to being available on the site.
Knowing this information earlier, would certainly have limited my frustration levels regardig why my commits were not being displayed!!	</p>

						
</p> Unit 2 and Unit 3- These units mostly focused on the theory behind computers.</p>
