<body>	<p><u> Collaborative Discussion 1</u></p>
<p><u>Discussion Topic: Project Failures Study</u></p>

<p>Please read the Lehtinen et al. (2014) paper and then answer the following questions:
<br>Question 1: What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure?
<br>Question 2: Give two examples of failures that support your choices (there are several examples in the lecturecast).</p>

	
	<p>A PDF of my contribution to the discussion is available to view below:</p>

<body>	<p><u> Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</u></p>
<p>Human emotions can affect the user experience, a fact which contributes to the complexity of user satisfaction with a product. 
<br>Further complicating the process is the fact that user emotions on the first use of a 
product are likely to be different to their emotions once they become more experienced. 
<br>Read Minge & Thuring (2018). Based on the change in human emotion over time, might you adapt Figure 1 in their paper in any way?</p>

<body>	<p><u> Unit 6 (Design Document)</u></p>
<p>For this assignment we were assigned groups with the following brief:
<br>As part of this first deliverable, you will need to produce a list of the requirements that you will include in the design of your toy.
<br>As part of the first deliverable, you should produce a sprint plan that describes how you carried out the requirements gathering, 
<br>design and how you will build the demo model/ simulation. This should include a description of the products involved in each sprint.</p>

<p>Our teams design proposal is available to view below</p>

<p><u>Development Team Project: Presentation</u></p>
<p>Carrying on from the Full Brief provided in Unit 6, this assignment focuses on the second deliverable, a presentation of your design from Unit 6.
This submission should consist of a presentation to the major stakeholders that consists of a status/ progress update, 
a demonstration of the demo model/simulation, and a plan and budget showing how the product will progress from design through 
implementation and ultimately UAT.For this assignment, you are required to record a 20-minute presentation, along with a transcript of the audio file. 
The presentation should include your demonstration. Your slides should not be wordy or repeat, verbatim, the oral presentation. 
Visuals, illustration, statistics, charts, tables and indication of key pointers are welcome. In assessing the presentation for marking, 
emphasis will be place on the oral content. However, clarity of the visual presentation will also be taken into account.</p>
