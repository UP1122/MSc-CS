<body>	<p><u> Unit 1 (Introduction to Information Systems)</u></p>
<p> Learning Outcomes:
-Understand the core elements of an information system.
-Appreciate the common issues that can arise when deploying a system.
-Gain an understanding of the SDLC, its phases and their importance.</p>

<p>This unit started out with a collaborative discussion. The instructions where:</p>
<p>Identify a specific incident (not covered in your reading list) where the failure of an information system has had a significant impact.
Your post could consider a range of impacts of the failure, including: the implications to customers, the economic cost, the reputational cost, or any other relevant impacts.</p>
	
	<p>My contribution to the discussion was as follows:</p>

<p> Adobe, in 2017, had announced its decision to remove support from its Adobe Flash player, and discontinue its use. This was in part, due to many vulnerabilities in its design, which lead to malware such as RIG Exploit Kit, Astrum Exploit Kit, Matrix Ransomware, Angler Exploit Kit and Ramnit, as well as others leading to information being insecure(1). Adobe’s plan was for complete discontinuation from the 12th January 2021, so as to allow enough time for companies to migrate to new and more secure systems(2).
The South African Revenue Services, collects tax revenue from approximately 5 million tax paying citizens in South Africa, as well as over 700 000 companies. VAT and customs duty collections are also managed by SARS(3).
Despite having a three-year warning, SARS was apparently caught unawares regarding migrating forms on its electronic filling site to the more secure and updated HTML5 software.</p>
<p>Consequences:
As a result of this incompetence, many users of the e-filling site have been unable to complete documents and submit said documents to SARS. To mitigate the impact, SARS has developed a special browser for users to file their tax returns. The browser is specially designed to use the outdated Adobe Flash player, to enable tax filing submission, against the advice of Adobe(4).
This may lead to increased exploitation by malicious parties. It is an astounding failure of the ICT team, which may impact revenue collection, or expose private citizens to unnecessary risk.</p>
<p> I was asked by my supervisor, how the IT team may have prevented this incident</p>
<p> The answer to this question is that the IT team needs to keep up to date with developments in the IT world, and appropriately prepare for changes.
The SARS failure was complete and gross negligence, impacting reveneue collection, which has a domino effect on service delivery. The IT team had 3 years to prepare
for the discontinuation of the flash player, yet, when the support was removed, the IT team had no plan in place to allow for business continuity. As a result
they scrambled together an unsecure, untested and frankly dangerous temporary solution to address the problem. This temporary solution, whilst workable, was
unnecessary and would have not been required, had the IT team adequately fulfilled their jobs. As a national revenue service, better management and 
	skills training needs to be done, to ensure adequate service delivery </p>		
	
	
	<body>	<p><u> Unit 7 (System Design)</u></p>
		<p>For this assignment we had to design the following:</p>
<p>-A class diagram.</p>
<p>-An activity diagram for the process of a customer completing an order.</p>
<p>-A state diagram highlighting the states of an order (and their transitions) for your proposed system.</p>

	<p>The scenario was as follows: You have been asked to design a software system for a well-known online store. The system will allow customers to 
		search for products sold at the website and add them to their shopping basket - at this stage an order is in progress. 
		Products are sold both by the website itself and several third-party sellers as part of the website’s marketplace. 
		Third-party sellers can be individuals or organisations, and once they have registered as a seller, they maintain their own product catalogue, 
		pricing and storefront. If a product is temporarily out of stock, then then it will be marked as unavailable.
		Once a customer has finished their shopping, the order is considered to be processing and they are taken through the checkout process, 
		where they will specify delivery details. Customers have the choice of several delivery options, including standard delivery using the 
		postal service and the company’s own in-house courier service. Products ordered from third-party sellers at the marketplace do not have 
		access to the in-house courier system. When the delivery options have been chosen, then the customer is presented with the payment options, 
		where they can opt to use a credit or debit card, an online payment service (e.g., PayPal) or a gift voucher.  
		Additionally, customers may also use promotional codes that are periodically issued by the website.  
		Customers have the option to store their payment details and so can simply use stored details for each purchase.  
		At this stage, the order is pending payment, but once the customer submits their payment information, the validity of the account 
		used (whether it is PayPal, a credit/debit card or gift voucher) will be verified by the appropriate service.  
		Upon successful completion, the order is awaiting picking. When a customer completes a transaction, the order is passed to the warehouse staff.  
		The warehouse staff will be required to look up the items on the stock database to determine the location of the item in the warehouse. 
		Once the items are successfully collected and packaged, the order will be considered ready for delivery and distributed to the 
		appropriate delivery company, depending on the customer’s preferences. When a member of the warehouse staff picks an item, 
		to fulfil a customer order, the item is scanned with a handheld terminal to automatically update the stock levels 
		(which will be reflected on the website). Finally, the order is collected by the appropriate delivery company and marked as shipped.</p>

	and neater drawing of diagrams.</p>
		
		


<p><u>Unit 8 (Hands-on with Database Design)</u></p>
<p>The assignment for this unit required us to :
	identify a NoSQL technology to research. Then post in the discussion forum detailing the key approaches of your chosen technology and 
	how its relative merits when compared with a traditional relational database.
Some types of NoSQL you might want to consider include:Graph databases, Key/value stores, Document stores and Object databases</p>	
<p> My contribution to the discussion was as follows:</p>
<p>  Relational database structures, such as sql have been around for many decades, and have a sort of “one size fits all” approach. 
Recently, due to “Big Data”, the nonrelational database structure such as Nosql have become increasingly popular(Wiktorski, 2019). 
It is estimated that 2.5 billion gigabytes of data are generated every day(Kalid et al., 2017).
One such example is Googles Big table. Its stated uses are for IoT, Financial analysis and adtech. It has been proven to be highly efficient as well as increased scalability. 
Bigtable uses a unique key value map store, using a row-key, column-key and timestamp approach(Kalid et al., 2017).  A use case scenario is for financial analysis, 
in collaboration with Dow Jones. The aim was to collate 30 years’ worth of news events with financial implications on businesses, 
small and large(Cloud Bigtable: NoSQL Database Service  |  Google Cloud, n.d.) An example as per the Dow Jones website, is the effect of Hurricanes in 2017, 
on businesses. This data was used to infer relationships between entities and the effects of the hurricanes on those entities(Dow Jones Case Study  |  Google Cloud, n.d.).  
This large amount of data would not be compatible with a traditional sql database due to its unstructured nature.

With the advent of big data, artificial intelligence, IoT and others, as well as non-structural data being generated, big data companies would certainly 
benefit from using nosql databases in certain processes. Sql databases, however, still have a place, especially for businesses dealing with structural data. 
It is unlikely and unwise to assume that there can only be one method, and the “one size fits all” approach cannot apply to the current exponential growth in data generation. 
Businesses would benefit in utilizing both systems for different outcomes.</p>
<p> In response to a collegues post on the Mongodb nosql database, I researched and found the following:</p>
<p>Advantages: Sharding as you had mentioned- Utilizing the power of multiple servers for database distribution and storage(Advantages of MongoDB | Disadvantages of MongoDB - DataFlair, n.d.). 
(An obvious current disadvantage here would be regarding the environmental cost of running many servers, however, when alternative energy sources are used, 
this disadvantage would be not applicable).
Scalability- The horizontally scalable nature of the Mongodb is attractive for growing businesses, allowing them to simply add more servers in order to grow. 
As mentioned previously, Currently the use of fossil fuels would negatively impact the environment when adding more servers. The problem is negated by using renewable energy. 
Speed- Mongodb is said to be 100 times faster than traditional sql databases, resulting in greatly improved performance(Gyorodi et al., 2015).
A disadvantage that I came across related to the limit on the size of files to 16mb. However, given the compression solutions available, I doubt that this 
would be a major problem.(All About MongoDB NoSQL Database: Advantages and Disadvantages, n.d.) 
Overall, it seems to be an impressive nosql database, with many possible applications. I agree with you fully, that traditional sql databases would 
continue to have a place, as well as nosql databases such as   Mongodb, chosen in relation to the design and function of the system</p>
		
<p>As a summary, I posted the following:</p>
<p>During this discussion, I have learnt much about non sql databases. From my own research in googles big table, to other databases explored by my colleagues, 
such as Mongodb and Neo4j. From this research, I can surmise the following:Non sql databases are increasingly being used for unstructured data. 
Some are open source, but many companies have developed their own non sql databases. This leads to the companies achieving a marketplace advantage, 
depending on how user friendly and robust their specific design is.
In addition, the horizontally scalable nature as well as sharding, may lead to improved efficiency and faster request times leading to improved performance. 
It also means that nosql databases are the preferred choice for larger or ever-changing data sets (Sumalatha, Vookanti and Vannala, 2021). 
This may have a determinantal effect on the environment, as more servers lead to increased power usage, so companies that utilize this system, 
should look into renewable energy sources in their system design so as to decrease their use and reliance on fossil fuels.
A performance comparison between mongodb and mysql when using an IoT device, showed similar performance in most areas, however, 
mongodb’s response time was slightly quicker in certain requests, while mysql was more stable. The authors conclude, that depending on the usage required, 
either database may be used for specific purposes. (Rautmare and Bhalerao, 2017)  
With regards to big data, the non schema nature, as well as possibility for dynamic scalability of the no sql database structure, makes it a promising 
choice for some businesses(Venkatraman et al., 2016).
Overall, it is unlikely that all businesses will benefit from switching to nonsql databases, and as such sql should be in use for many years to come.</p>

						
			
<p><u>Unit 11 (Web Development in Python)</u></p>
		<p>For this assignment, we had to implement the previous system design, into a usable solution for an online shopping company
		I successfully developed a system in PyCharm using Python and sqlite as a database storage. I was particularly proud of the outcome
			of this assignment, accomplishing all required parameters and testing the sytem through many iterations
			(hundreds of hours went into creating and testing). I have made the file available to view below/p>
