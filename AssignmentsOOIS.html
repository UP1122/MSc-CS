<body>	<p><u> Unit 1 (Introduction to Information Systems)</u></p>
<p> Learning Outcomes:
-Understand the core elements of an information system.
-Appreciate the common issues that can arise when deploying a system.
-Gain an understanding of the SDLC, its phases and their importance.</p>

<p>This unit started out with a collaborative discussion. The instructions where:</p>
<p>Identify a specific incident (not covered in your reading list) where the failure of an information system has had a significant impact.
Your post could consider a range of impacts of the failure, including: the implications to customers, the economic cost, the reputational cost, or any other relevant impacts.</p>
	
	<p>My contribution to the discussion was as follows:</p>

<p> Adobe, in 2017, had announced its decision to remove support from its Adobe Flash player, and discontinue its use. This was in part, due to many vulnerabilities in its design, which lead to malware such as RIG Exploit Kit, Astrum Exploit Kit, Matrix Ransomware, Angler Exploit Kit and Ramnit, as well as others leading to information being insecure(1). Adobe’s plan was for complete discontinuation from the 12th January 2021, so as to allow enough time for companies to migrate to new and more secure systems(2).

The South African Revenue Services, collects tax revenue from approximately 5 million tax paying citizens in South Africa, as well as over 700 000 companies. VAT and customs duty collections are also managed by SARS(3).

Despite having a three-year warning, SARS was apparently caught unawares regarding migrating forms on its electronic filling site to the more secure and updated HTML5 software.</p>

<p>Consequences:

As a result of this incompetence, many users of the e-filling site have been unable to complete documents and submit said documents to SARS. To mitigate the impact, SARS has developed a special browser for users to file their tax returns. The browser is specially designed to use the outdated Adobe Flash player, to enable tax filing submission, against the advice of Adobe(4).

This may lead to increased exploitation by malicious parties. It is an astounding failure of the ICT team, which may impact revenue collection, or expose private citizens to unnecessary risk.</p>

<p> I was asked by my supervisor, how the IT team may have prevented this incident</p>
<p> The answer to this question is that the IT team needs to keep up to date with developments in the IT world, and appropriately prepare for changes.
The SARS failure was complete and gross negligence, impacting reveneue collection, which has a domino effect on service delivery. The IT team had 3 years to prepare
for the discontinuation of the flash player, yet, when the support was removed, the IT team had no plan in place to allow for business continuity. As a result
they scrambled together an unsecure, untested and frankly dangerous temporary solution to address the problem. This temporary solution, whilst workable, was
unnecessary and would have not been required, had the IT team adequately fulfilled their jobs. As a national revenue service, better management and 
	skills training needs to be done, to ensure adequate service delivery </p>		
	
	
	<body>	<p><u> Unit 7 (System Design)</u></p>
		<p>For this assignment we had to design the following:</p>
<p>A class diagram.</p>
<p>An activity diagram for the process of a customer completing an order.</p>
<p>A state diagram highlighting the states of an order (and their transitions) for your proposed system.</p>

	<p>The scenario was as follows: You have been asked to design a software system for a well-known online store. The system will allow customers to 
		search for products sold at the website and add them to their shopping basket - at this stage an order is in progress. 
		Products are sold both by the website itself and several third-party sellers as part of the website’s marketplace. 
		Third-party sellers can be individuals or organisations, and once they have registered as a seller, they maintain their own product catalogue, 
		pricing and storefront. If a product is temporarily out of stock, then then it will be marked as unavailable.
		Once a customer has finished their shopping, the order is considered to be processing and they are taken through the checkout process, 
		where they will specify delivery details. Customers have the choice of several delivery options, including standard delivery using the 
		postal service and the company’s own in-house courier service. Products ordered from third-party sellers at the marketplace do not have 
		access to the in-house courier system. When the delivery options have been chosen, then the customer is presented with the payment options, 
		where they can opt to use a credit or debit card, an online payment service (e.g., PayPal) or a gift voucher.  
		Additionally, customers may also use promotional codes that are periodically issued by the website.  
		Customers have the option to store their payment details and so can simply use stored details for each purchase.  
		At this stage, the order is pending payment, but once the customer submits their payment information, the validity of the account 
		used (whether it is PayPal, a credit/debit card or gift voucher) will be verified by the appropriate service.  
		Upon successful completion, the order is awaiting picking. When a customer completes a transaction, the order is passed to the warehouse staff.  
		The warehouse staff will be required to look up the items on the stock database to determine the location of the item in the warehouse. 
		Once the items are successfully collected and packaged, the order will be considered ready for delivery and distributed to the 
		appropriate delivery company, depending on the customer’s preferences. When a member of the warehouse staff picks an item, 
		to fulfil a customer order, the item is scanned with a handheld terminal to automatically update the stock levels 
		(which will be reflected on the website). Finally, the order is collected by the appropriate delivery company and marked as shipped.</p>
