<body>	<p><u> Collaborative Discussion 1</u></p>
	<p><u>Discussion Topic:Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</p></u>

<p>Pick a case study from the examples provided by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).
<br>Review the application of the ethics code to the situation described and highlight the impact on any relevant legal (jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional) 
<br>and social issues, as well as on the professionalism of the computing professionals involved. You should provide comparisons 
<br>to the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct</p>

  <body><p><u>Reflective activity - Ethics in Computing</p></u>

<p>Read Stahl et al (2016) and Bott (2018) Chapter 1. In the Stahl et al (2016) paper, the authors state that 
<br>“many of the authors involved in researching the ethics of computing remain wedded to their disciplinary traditions and 
<br>fail to provide actionable advice to relevant stakeholders.”
<br>Consider yourself as a relevant stakeholder, a Computing professional working for a company of your choice. 
<br>Examine how one or more of the ethical issues mentioned affect your role in the company and what actions you would need to/can take. 
<br>You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature. 
<br>Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues. 
<br>Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help you evaluate the legal, social ethical 
<br>and professional issues that affect computing professionals in industry.

  <body><p><u>Reflective activity2-Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</p></u>
  
<p>In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) 
<br>for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data 
<br>through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). 
<br>This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. 
<br>However, this happens often through various media.
<br>Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of 
<br>inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, 
<br>social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.

<body>	<p><u> Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</u></p>
<p>Case Study: Accuracy of information
<br>Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to 
<br>review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform 
<br>the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi 
<br>has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.
<br>Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. 
<br>“After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”</p>

  <p><u> Literature Review</u></p>
<p>For this assignment we were tasked with writing a literature review based on the topic chosen
<br>I chose to examine the use of IS to transoform the healthcare sector in South Africa .</p>

<p><u>Development Team Project: Presentation</u></p>
<p>Carrying on from the Full Brief provided in Unit 6, this assignment focuses on the second deliverable, a presentation of your design from Unit 6.
This submission should consist of a presentation to the major stakeholders that consists of a status/ progress update, 
a demonstration of the demo model/simulation, and a plan and budget showing how the product will progress from design through 
implementation and ultimately UAT.For this assignment, you are required to record a 20-minute presentation, along with a transcript of the audio file. 
The presentation should include your demonstration. Your slides should not be wordy or repeat, verbatim, the oral presentation. 
Visuals, illustration, statistics, charts, tables and indication of key pointers are welcome. In assessing the presentation for marking, 
emphasis will be place on the oral content. However, clarity of the visual presentation will also be taken into account.</p>
<p><li><a href= "Presentation Transcript and Video Link.docx" class="button" src= "Presentation Transcript and Video Link.docx">Final Presentation</a></li></p>
	
<p> During the course of the project, we had multiple hours of team meetings. Below are the minutes of the meetings</p>
<p><li><a href= "Meeting Minutes SEPM21.zip" class="button" src= "Meeting Minutes SEPM21.zip">Meeting Minutes</a></li></p>

<p><u>Future Trends in SEPM</u></p>
	
<p>As a team, choose ONE of the trends from the reading list in units 11 and 12.  Then prepare a five-minute presentation that 
<br>argues why the trend you chose is the MOST influential one and will have the most influence on the field of 
<br>software engineering project management in the next ten years. You will need to support the provided research with 
<br>additional texts that you locate, including the articles from units 11 and 12. We will vote in a poll during the 
<br>seminar to discover which presentation was the most compelling and which the class agrees will be the most influential trend.</p>
<p>Our team believes that blockchain technology would be most influential in the next decade</p>
