<body>	<p><u> Collaborative Discussion 1</u></p>
	<p><u>Discussion Topic:Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</p></u>

<p>Pick a case study from the examples provided by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).
<br>Review the application of the ethics code to the situation described and highlight the impact on any relevant legal (jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional) 
<br>and social issues, as well as on the professionalism of the computing professionals involved. You should provide comparisons 
<br>to the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct</p>

  <body><p><u>Reflective activity - Ethics in Computing</p></u>

<p>Read Stahl et al (2016) and Bott (2018) Chapter 1. In the Stahl et al (2016) paper, the authors state that 
<br>“many of the authors involved in researching the ethics of computing remain wedded to their disciplinary traditions and 
<br>fail to provide actionable advice to relevant stakeholders.”
<br>Consider yourself as a relevant stakeholder, a Computing professional working for a company of your choice. 
<br>Examine how one or more of the ethical issues mentioned affect your role in the company and what actions you would need to/can take. 
<br>You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature. 
<br>Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues. 
<br>Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help you evaluate the legal, social ethical 
<br>and professional issues that affect computing professionals in industry.

  <body><p><u>Reflective activity2-Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</p></u>
  
<p>In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) 
<br>for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data 
<br>through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). 
<br>This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. 
<br>However, this happens often through various media.
<br>Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of 
<br>inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, 
<br>social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.

<body>	<p><u> Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</u></p>
<p>Case Study: Accuracy of information
<br>Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to 
<br>review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform 
<br>the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi 
<br>has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.
<br>Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. 
<br>“After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”</p>
