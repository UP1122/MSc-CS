</header>

								
<body>	<p><u> Unit 1 (Introduction to Information Systems)</u></p>
<p> Learning Outcomes:
-Understand the core elements of an information system.
-Appreciate the common issues that can arise when deploying a system.
-Gain an understanding of the SDLC, its phases and their importance.</p>
<p>This unit started out with the creation of this e-portfolio. This proved to be an exceptionally difficult task, given that I had no experience in html.
However, after many hours of testing, researching and modifying, my site was up! It did not look great, but I had achieved the task. A note to take into account 
(Which I was not aware of, and resulted in much frustration) was that after comitting a code, there is a slight delay, from the time of the commit to being available on the site.
Knowing this information earlier, would certainly have limited my frustration levels regarding why my commits were not being displayed!!	</p>

						
<p><u> Unit 2 (Intro to computer architecture and functionality) and Unit 3 (Emerging trends in computer science)</u></p>
<p>These units mostly focused on the theory behind computers. We were also introduced to concepts such as Artificial Intelligence, Big data and cloud
computing. I already had an interest in Artificial Intelligence, so learning more about these concepts were very interesting.</p>

<p><u> Unit 4 (Computer Infrastructure and Network) and Unit 5 (Software as a Tool - Its Functionality and Development Methodologies) </u></p>

<p>We had started coding!! This was particularly informative and fun, learning how to code in Python. Python is quite a logical language with structure
and set rules. Its also proved quite easy to pick up, once the basics are in place. This unit also required a draft proposal on: 
A brief outline of the organisation and problem to explore.
A discussion of the issues that you wish to investigate for the organisation, i.e., the current situation, what you wish to propose, problems, 
rationale for the selection of technology, and so on.

My initial proposal wished to evaluate the social and corporate responsibility of ABC inc, which is the parent company of Google</p>

<p><u>Unit 6(System Software – Operating Systems)</u></p>

<p>Continue with coding in codio. I learnt: Basic skills, Operators, Conditionals and Loops. DIfficult, but rewarding, especially when the code works out!
Learnt alot about indentation, and their importance</p>

<p><u>Unit 7 (Data Abstraction) and Unit 8 (An Introduction to Algorithms and Basic Programming Concepts)</u></p>
<p> Continued with coding in codio, and submitted the first of three summative assignments. The assignment required us to: 1- conduct a sequential search of a list
2- Conduct a bubble sort of a list, 3- Identify the correct code of a binary tree representation, and 4- Draw a binary tree
	</p>

<p><u>Unit 9 (Solving Problems Using Python) and Unit 10 (Data Representation using Database Concepts)</u> </p>
<p> Learnt to write an algorithm and was introduced to database structures, such as sql. Also completed the second assignment, regarding algorithms</p>

<p><u>Unit 11(Advanced SQL) and Unit 12 (Research Topics in Computer Science – Data Science, AI and Standards)</u></p>
<p>Learnt more about sql and completed excercises in codio. I also submitted my final assignment of the course, which required us to:
1- Select an emerging theme to investigate from the ECIS 2020 conference, 2- Decide on the direction of the research and a company to conduct a case study on,
3- Investigate the issues in context of the chosen organisation. I selected blockchain technology, with a focus on the IBM blockchain for business.</p>


<p>This module was concluded, having achieved a distinction</p>
