									<p> The second module out of a total of 6 in the Master of Computer Science degree. </p>
										
<p>This module focused on Object orientated computer systems.</p>
</header>

								
<body>	<p><u> Unit 1 (Introduction to Information Systems)</u></p>
<p> Learning Outcomes:
-Understand the core elements of an information system.
-Appreciate the common issues that can arise when deploying a system.
-Gain an understanding of the SDLC, its phases and their importance.</p>

<p>This unit started out with a collaborative discussion. The instructions where:</p>
<p>Identify a specific incident (not covered in your reading list) where the failure of an information system has had a significant impact.
Your post could consider a range of impacts of the failure, including: the implications to customers, the economic cost, the reputational cost, or any other relevant impacts.</p>
	
	<p>My contribution to the discussion was as follows:</p>

<p> Adobe, in 2017, had announced its decision to remove support from its Adobe Flash player, and discontinue its use. This was in part, due to many vulnerabilities in its design, which lead to malware such as RIG Exploit Kit, Astrum Exploit Kit, Matrix Ransomware, Angler Exploit Kit and Ramnit, as well as others leading to information being insecure(1). Adobe’s plan was for complete discontinuation from the 12th January 2021, so as to allow enough time for companies to migrate to new and more secure systems(2).

The South African Revenue Services, collects tax revenue from approximately 5 million tax paying citizens in South Africa, as well as over 700 000 companies. VAT and customs duty collections are also managed by SARS(3).

Despite having a three-year warning, SARS was apparently caught unawares regarding migrating forms on its electronic filling site to the more secure and updated HTML5 software.</p>

<p>Consequences:

As a result of this incompetence, many users of the e-filling site have been unable to complete documents and submit said documents to SARS. To mitigate the impact, SARS has developed a special browser for users to file their tax returns. The browser is specially designed to use the outdated Adobe Flash player, to enable tax filing submission, against the advice of Adobe(4).

This may lead to increased exploitation by malicious parties. It is an astounding failure of the ICT team, which may impact revenue collection, or expose private citizens to unnecessary risk.</p>

<p> I was asked by my supervisor, how the IT team may have prevented this incident</p>
<p> The answer to this question is that the IT team needs to keep up to date with developments in the IT world, and appropriately prepare for changes.
The SARS failure was complete and gross negligence, impacting reveneue collection, which has a domino effect on service delivery. The IT team had 3 years to prepare
for the discontinuation of the flash player, yet, when the support was removed, the IT team had no plan in place to allow for business continuity. As a result
they scrambled together an unsecure, untested and frankly dangerous temporary solution to address the problem. This temporary solution, whilst workable, was
unnecessary and would have not been required, had the IT team adequately fulfilled their jobs. As a national revenue service, better management and 
	skills training needs to be done, to ensure adequate service delivery </p>

	
	
<p><u> Unit 2 (Intro to computer architecture and functionality) and Unit 3 (Emerging trends in computer science)</u></p>
<p>These units mostly focused on the theory behind computers. We were also introduced to concepts such as Artificial Intelligence, Big data and cloud
computing. I already had an interest in Artificial Intelligence, so learning more about these concepts were very interesting.</p>

<p><u> Unit 4 (Computer Infrastructure and Network) and Unit 5 (Software as a Tool - Its Functionality and Development Methodologies) </u></p>

<p>We had started coding!! This was particularly informative and fun, learning how to code in Python. Python is quite a logical language with structure
and set rules. Its also proved quite easy to pick up, once the basics are in place. This unit also required a draft proposal on: 
A brief outline of the organisation and problem to explore.
A discussion of the issues that you wish to investigate for the organisation, i.e., the current situation, what you wish to propose, problems, 
rationale for the selection of technology, and so on.

My initial proposal wished to evaluate the social and corporate responsibility of ABC inc, which is the parent company of Google</p>

<p><u>Unit 6(System Software – Operating Systems)</u></p>

<p>Continue with coding in codio. I learnt: Basic skills, Operators, Conditionals and Loops. DIfficult, but rewarding, especially when the code works out!
Learnt alot about indentation, and their importance</p>

<p><u>Unit 7 (Data Abstraction) and Unit 8 (An Introduction to Algorithms and Basic Programming Concepts)</u></p>
<p> Continued with coding in codio, and submitted the first of three summative assignments. The assignment required us to: 1- conduct a sequential search of a list
2- Conduct a bubble sort of a list, 3- Identify the correct code of a binary tree representation, and 4- Draw a binary tree
	</p>

<p><u>Unit 9 (Solving Problems Using Python) and Unit 10 (Data Representation using Database Concepts)</u> </p>
<p> Learnt to write an algorithm and was introduced to database structures, such as sql. Also completed the second assignment, regarding algorithms</p>

<p><u>Unit 11(Advanced SQL) and Unit 12 (Research Topics in Computer Science – Data Science, AI and Standards)</u></p>
<p>Learnt more about sql and completed excercises in codio. I also submitted my final assignment of the course, which required us to:
1- Select an emerging theme to investigate from the ECIS 2020 conference, 2- Decide on the direction of the research and a company to conduct a case study on,
3- Investigate the issues in context of the chosen organisation. I selected blockchain technology, with a focus on the IBM blockchain for business.</p>


<p>This module was concluded, having achieved a distinction</p>
