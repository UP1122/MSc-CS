<body>	<p><u> Blog Post 1 : Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare </u></p>
<p> Artificial intelligence has always been an interesting topic to me. I have often thought about how healthcare could be improved by using 
artificial intelligence to supplement human intellect.</p> 

<p>A company that has piqued my interest is PathAI(PathAI, n.d.). In collaboration with Novartis, they have revolutionized their digital pathology department, 
which utilizes information systems to assist pathologists in making a quick and accurate diagnosis. The task of the AI is when given a pathology 
slide, to identify the type of cancer, the different cell types, and accurately predict the 5-year survival probability. It accomplishes 
this by incorporates machine learning algorithms to identify cell types and size, and correlate this information with real world data. 
The system does not replace the role of the pathologist. It simply provides “an extra set of eyes”, which then allows the pathologist to 
verify the findings and confirm a diagnosis(Artificial Intelligence Decodes Cancer Pathology Images | Novartis, n.d.). 
They are also working on solutions to identify patients that may qualify for novel therapies, thus creating a tailor made and personal approach to cancer treatment.</p> 

<p>Another company that greatly interests me is us2.Ai(Us2.Ai - Smart Ultrasound Automating the Fight against Heart DiseaseUs2.Ai, 2021). 
They have identified heart disease as an area of interest and focus, with the following challenges:</p><br>
- Slow examination, taking at least 30 minutes per patient.<br>
- Staff and experience shortages, resulting in adequate care, especially in developing nations.<br>
- Expensive hardware costs, with minimal or slow support for breakdowns(Us2.Ai Company Profile — StartUp Health, n.d.).
<p>They are developing an AI assisted echocardiography solution, which speeds up diagnosis time, reduces the need for expensive equipment, 
and allows for early intervention to prevent heart disease. They plan to utilize machine learning software and deep learning models to accurately 
diagnose and predict future illness. If they are successful, rural areas or developing nations with limited resources may be able to have access 
to specialist level experience with just a phone and an internet connection. 

<p>A significant hurdle in using AI in healthcare, is the issue of data ownership and data collection. Regulations are already in place, 
such as the GDPR, to prevent collection and monetization of data without consent(Panch et al., 2019). However, there has to be a trade 
off between the needs of privacy versus the need to improve healthcare systems, treatments and overall wellbeing. One such compromise 
is “pseudonymization”, which protects the privacy and identity of patients, whilst still allowing a linkage of data to pseudo- ID’s. 
This method is preferable to anonymization due to the complex nature of healthcare data(Tinabo et al., 2009).</p>
	
<p>AI has made significant strides into the realm of healthcare, albeit with a few bumps along the way. However, future development 
is inevitable, and it will be interesting to observe its revolution of the healthcare system.</p>
